    "story.p1": "Between us, we've spent over three years inside UAE schools — running events, coordinating calendars, chasing suppliers, and standing next to nervous principals at 6am on event day. We loved the work and hated the chaos. The same last-minute rushes, the same vendor phone calls, the same frantic WhatsApp threads the night before.",
    "story.p2": "So in 2024 we built the team we wished we'd had: one point of contact, transparent budgets, calm on the day, and a real plan B. Vita Nova is what event management looks like when it's run by people who've actually been on the other side of the clipboard.",

    "faq.eyebrow": "Common questions",
    "faq.title": "Things schools ask before they book",
    "faq.q1.t": "How far in advance should we book?",
    "faq.q1.d": "<p>Ideally 6–8 weeks for most events, 12+ weeks for annual days and graduations. We've also pulled off miracles in two weeks when a school suddenly finds out the Minister is visiting — but more time always means a calmer day.</p>",
    "faq.q2.t": "Do you handle permits and approvals?",
    "faq.q2.d": "<p>Yes. We coordinate with the relevant UAE authorities for venue, fire, safety, and child-event permits, and we share a risk assessment with your leadership team before the day.</p>",
    "faq.q3.t": "Can you work with our budget?",
    "faq.q3.d": "<p>Always. We present a transparent budget with three tiers before you commit, and every dirham is tracked in a shared sheet so you always know where the money went.</p>",
    "faq.q4.t": "Do you provide the equipment and decor?",
    "faq.q4.d": "<p>Yes — sound, lighting, staging, decor, signage, photo walls, marquees, and anything else you need. Everything is rented or sourced, never permanent, and we leave your campus exactly as we found it.</p>",
    "faq.q5.t": "Are your staff child-safeguarding trained?",
    "faq.q5.d": "<p>Every Vita Nova team member is safeguarding-trained and background-checked. We follow your school's safeguarding policy on the day, and we never photograph or film students without explicit consent.</p>",
    "faq.q6.t": "Which Emirates do you cover?",
    "faq.q6.d": "<p>All seven. We have vetted suppliers in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, Ras Al Khaimah, and Fujairah.</p>",
    "faq.q7.t": "What happens after the event?",
    "faq.q7.d": "<p>You receive a full debrief within a week: photos, video highlights, attendance and spend reports, plus a short debrief call so next year is even better.</p>",
    "faq.q8.t": "Can we see a sample timeline first?",
    "faq.q8.d": "<p>Of course. After our first call we'll send a sample run-of-show and budget for the kind of event you have in mind — no obligation, yours to keep.</p>",

    "timeline.eyebrow": "From kick-off to curtain up",
    "timeline.title": "What an event timeline actually looks like.",

    "c2.t": "Eid timing",
    "c2.d": "We never schedule on the first day of either Eid. Around Eid we shift events to give families breathing room and lean into Eid-themed decor where appropriate.",
    "c3.t": "UAE National Day",
    "c3.d": "Flag ceremonies, heritage activities, and Emirati-themed annual days. Our National Day kits come with the right symbols done with respect — never as costume.",
    "c4.t": "Flag Day",
    "c4.d": "Quick morning assemblies and campus-wide flag moments. We handle the coordination so the tribute feels genuine, not performative.",
    "c5.t": "Hijri observances",

    "faq.q2.d": "<p>Oui. Nous coordonnons avec les autorités émiriennes concernées les autorisations de lieu, d'incendie, de sécurité et d'événements pour enfants, et nous partageons une évaluation des risques avec votre équipe de direction avant le jour J.</p>",
